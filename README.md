# bs-rpc
A simple Discord RPC that displays what you're playing in Beat Saber.

# Mod Dependencies
This RPC will need some mods to function correctly;
- [DataPuller (and its dependencies)](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BSDataPuller) (this can be installed from ModAssistant)
- [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org)

# How To Run
Clone this repository and open it in a command prompt/terminal. Then, just run ```npm start```! It's that easy!
Note that this will **only** work if you have everything installed AND Beat Saber is running.
